# India Engineering Salary Prediction Using ML

### Introduction
The goal of this project is to develop a predictive model that can accurately estimate the annual salary of engineering job candidates in India based on various features. This can be useful for both job seekers and employers to understand salary trends and make informed decisions.

### Models and Techniques
The following machine learning algorithms were explored in this project:

<ul>
  <li>Linear Regression</li>
  <li>Decision Tree Regressor</li>
  <li>Random Forest Regressor</li>
  <li>XGBoost Regressor</li>
</ul>

### Results
The performance of each model is evaluated using metrics such as **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**, **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**, and **R-squared (RÂ²)**.
